Bias Continuity Analysis | Course Project
Objective
Analyze Decision-Making: Identify shifts from symbolic to experiential choices when symbolic options underperform.
Identify Decision Trends: Investigate the point where participants begin preferring experiential options, analyzing decision-making patterns.
Approach
Game Design: Developed a 2-Alternative Forced Choice game using PsychoPy in Python to collect user input and provide feedback.
Data Collection: Tracked participant choices during the training and scoring phases, each consisting of 20 trials, to observe decision-making patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted analysis using Excel to pinpoint the breaking point where experiential choices began to dominate.
Results
Shift in Preferences: Identified a significant shift towards experiential options after 10 choices, with 87.5% of participants altering their preferences.
Hypothesis Validation: Demonstrated that participants tend to prefer experiential options over underperforming symbolic ones.
Tools Used
Python: For game development and participant tracking.
PsychoPy: To create the decision-making game.
Excel: For conducting statistical analysis.
